```

## R Markdown

## Get the critical value for a confidence level using qnorm(confidence level)

```{r For 95%}
qnorm(0.975)

```

```{r For 99%}
qnorm(0.995)

```
## Get the unshaded area of a distribution (in order to find the p-value) using pnorm(z)

```{r}
1-pnorm(2.47)
```

Get the shaded area of a distribution for the F distribution
pf(F statistic,df1,df2,lower.tail=FALSE)

```{r}
 pf(1.994,3,323,lower.tail=FALSE)
```


Calculate t*df
```{r}
qt(0.975,df=199)
```


calculate t-distribution for two sided
```{r}
2*pt(2.485,df=25,lower.tail=FALSE)
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
